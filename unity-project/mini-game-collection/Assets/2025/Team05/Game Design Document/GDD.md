* **Define the desired game mechanic or feature**

The core mechanic of our design is a single lap racing system that combines fast paced movement with skill based obstacle navigation. Two players must complete one full lap as quickly as possible while trying to sabotage their opponent also while avoiding obstacles. The feature is designed to create immediate tension and make players feel competitive.

* **Outline an objective statement for the design**. What question are you trying to answer with your prototype? Why?

Our objective is to explore how competitive and engaging a single lap race can be when designed for an arcade cabinet. By combining obstacles, fast paced racing and opportunities to sabotage your opponent, we aim to determine whether players can quickly pick up the game and experience a sense of challenge and competition within a short replayable format.

* **Detail design rationale**. What kind of experience do you envision? How is it innovative or experimental?

Our design is innovative in its simplicity and focus. Instead of a long, multi lap race we condense the experience into one loop that tests quick learning, adaptability and precision. The obstacles implemented are added to keep the race challenging and fair. The arcade cabinet format enhances gameplay because you are face to face with your opponent. Short rounds, quick restarts and visible score create a social and competitive atmosphere.
